### Can I take more protection measures regarding Cookies ?

Well yes, there are a few more things you can do to increase your security and better protect yourself. For example, we can recommend extensions for your browser such as 'cookie autodelete' that deletes cookies after you visit the web. Here are the links for Firefox and Chrome:

If you have Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/

But cookies are not the only way to keep track of what we leave when we browse, there are other "tracker" elements that can be used to find out our browsing patterns and that can provide information to create profiles. As in everything, there are "good" and "bad" trackers and it is not so easy to protect yourself. This is known as Tracking and browsers also offer control possibilities in this regard.
